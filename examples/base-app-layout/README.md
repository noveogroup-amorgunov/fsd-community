# base-app-layout

This example shows how to work with layout (or layouts). Split layout to dumb component (with markup) and smart component for widget compositions. Dumb layout can be placed in `@shared/ui/Layout`, smart - `~app/layouts/AppLayout.tsx`. See [`~app/layouts/appLayout.tsx`](./src/app/layouts/AppLayout.tsx) and [`~shared/ui/layout/*`](./src/shared/ui/layout) in code.
